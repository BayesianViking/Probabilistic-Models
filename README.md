# Ask for access to my distributions library if you want access to the Torus Distributions. Otherwise you can use two regular Von Mises distributions and delete the lambda parameter in the models.

VAE = Variational Autoencoder
BVMS and SSBVMS are abreviations for two Probability Distributions I have implemented. They are Toroidal versions of the Multivariate Normal.
